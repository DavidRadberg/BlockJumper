    BlockJumper

The aim of this project is to create some kind of
3D game using C++ and openGL for education (and fun?).

The project is a WIP that may never be finished...

So far we have a renderer that can load blocks with texture
and/or .obj objects, and a camera that can be controller by
a gamepad controller (keyboard controls not implemented yet).

    Building

The project requires glfw 3.3 that I currently build from source, glad and glm.
build with:
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..; make

start controller drivers, for example with:
sudo xboxdrv --silent

and then (from separate terminal)
./BlockJumper
